[00:00:00] Speaker 1: Yeah, and so physically, obviously you were impacted, but tell us what it was like emotionally. What were your moods like being isolated for so long?
[00:00:09] Speaker 2: I think one of the biggest challenges for me and what I'm seeing is for the clients I know that have struggled with this, is you get into your head and you start getting anxious because you're seeing on the media that people are, you know, in dire straits, they're in hospitals, they're in, they're, they're fighting for their life, and you're wondering if you are, you are gonna end up in that space, if you're gonna end up in that place.
[00:00:35] Speaker 1: So I had to be really careful about not, I would go into these scary places in my head and say, Heidi, get out of there.
[00:00:41] Speaker 2: You know, because it was, I was really working myself up.
[00:00:45] Speaker 2: Um, there are, there, I think in about day three I started getting depressed, um, and started figuring out, feeling like, okay, I've got to do what I tell my clients.
[00:00:55] Speaker 2: I have to practice what I preach because I am starting to get depressed.
[00:00:59] Speaker 2: I'm isolated in my room and I'm feeling anxious that it's gonna get worse.
[00:01:05] Speaker 1: That sounds really overwhelming. But I'm grateful you shared that with us.
[00:01:10] Speaker 2: Thank you. I felt so frustrated at first, but then I found some hope.
[00:01:15] Speaker 1: It takes strength to be vulnerable like that. I'm proud of your determination.
[00:01:20] Speaker 2: I was excited to discover new ways to find calm and peaceful moments, even during despair.
